> Hi üëã ! We are Eric, Manel, I√±igo and Agus. </br>
> We developed a Library Management System application using Java!
> You may want to take a look on how the app works, so lets get on it!üßê

## Funcionamiento:

As you may imagine, the user of a library app needs to search a book applying certain filters, borrow this book and finally return it.
All these tasks (and some others) are implemented through the use of commands that will be shown to the user as a number list menu.
These commands are the following:



## Setup
